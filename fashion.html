    <div class="fashioncaja2"><p class="fashionp">Golf le Fleur was introduced at the Golf Wang fashion show at Made L.A. on June 11, 2016.
        Named "Golf le Fleur" (stylized as "GOLF le FLEUR*"), it was first introduced as a shoe collaboration between Tyler, 
        the Creator and Converse. The collection was named "GOLF le FLEUR*" to mean Flower Boy in French though the translation 
        is inaccurate. It was released in the same year as Tyler's Flower Boy album.] First made available to the public on July 13, 2017, 
        the first design released was Converse One Star shoes in a new, light blue colorway called "Clearwater".</p>
